## Project Template

This is a starter template for final projects. When you have completed your final project, you should replace this message (README.md) with a short 1-2 paragraph description of your project.

Clone this repository to your local computer to get started. To install all necessary python dependencies, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder with this repository, and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If this does not work, try `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You will also need to edit the `mkdocs.yml` file in Atom (or other text editor). All of your pages must be located inside the docs directory (or subfolders). You should edit the existing index page (docs/index.md) to your liking, but do not delete or rename it.

To test your project, navigate to your project directory and type `mkdocs serve`. Then, go to your browser and enter `127.0.0.1:8000` into the URL bar. You should see your main index page.

* Try this in-browser [Markdown Editor](http://dillinger.io/), it has a live preview

If you want to use a custom MkDocs theme, you can find some online. Simply replace the contents of the theme directory with the files from your custom theme (make sure that the folder is still named theme).
